"""Comparing three different iron electrowinning technologies

This script runs an end-to-end iron production system (including the mine) and compares the
levelized cost of sponge_iron across three different iron electrowinning technologies to see
how their costs compare:
    - Aqueous Hydroxide Electrolysis (AHE)
    - Molten Salt Electrolysis (MSE)
    - Molten Oxide Electrolysis (MOE)

New users may find it helpful to look at the tech_config.yaml (particularly the iron_plant) to see
how the technologies were set up, as well as the  plant_config.yaml (particularly the
technology_interconnections) to see how the technologies were connected.

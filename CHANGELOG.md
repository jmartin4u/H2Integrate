# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.X, Unreleased, TBD

- Added geologic hydrogen (geoh2) converter and examples [PR 135](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/135)

## 0.3.1, Unreleased, TBD

- Added methanol production base class
- Added steam methane reforming methanol production technology
- Added a new optimization example with a wind plant and electrolyzer to showcase how to define design variables, constraints, and objective functions
- Added capability for user-defined technologies in the H2Integrate framework, allowing for custom models to be integrated into the system.
- Added an example of a user-defined technology in the `examples` directory, demonstrating an extremely simple paper mill model.
- Added a run of river hydro plant model, an example, and a documentation page.
- Updated the naming scheme throughout the framework so resources produced always have `_out` and resources consumed always have `_in` in their names.
- Removed the `to_organize` directory.
- Split out the electrolyzer cost models `basic` and `singlitico` for clarity.
- Bump min Python version and removed unnecessary packages from `pyproject.toml.
- Moved `overwrite_fin_values` to HOPP
- Enable optimization with HOPP technology ratings using `recreate_hopp_config_for_optimization`
- Added example for running with HOPP as the only technology in the H2Integrate system
- Made caching in the HOPP wrapper optional
- Expanded docs to include a new section on modifying config dicts after model instantiation.
- Added a check for if a custom model's name clashes with an existing model name in the H2Integrate framework, raising an error if it does.
- Refactored the ammonia production model to use the new H2Integrate framework natively and removed the prior performance and cost functions.
- Added a new ammonia production model which has nitrogen, hydrogen, and electricity inputs and ammonia output, with performance and cost functions.
- Added more available constraints from the HOPP wrapper useful for design optimizations

## 0.3.0 [May 2 2025]

- Introduced a fully new underlying framework for H2Integrate which uses [OpenMDAO](https://openmdao.org/), allowing for more flexibility and extensibility in the future
- Expanded introductory documentation
- Added TOL/MCH hydrogen storage cost model

## 0.2.1, Unreleased, TBD

- Fixed iron data save issue [PR 122](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/122)

- Bug-fix in electrolyzer outputs (H2_Results) if some stacks are never turned on.

## 0.2 [7 April 2025]

- Allow users to save the H2IntegrateOutput class as a yaml file and read that yaml to an instance of the output class
- Include new plotting capabilities: (1) hydrogen storage, production, and dispatch; (2) electricity and hydrogen dispatch
- Remove reference_plants from examples. Reference plants can now be found in the [ReferenceHybridSystemDesigns](https://github.com/NREL/ReferenceHybridSystemDesigns) repository.
- Use sentence capitalization for plot labels and legends
- Use "metric ton" instead of "tonne" or "metric tonne" in all internal naming and plots
- Fix bug in hydrogen dispatch plotting by storing time series of hydrogen demand by hour
- Update the PEM efficiency to 51.0 kWh/kg from 54.6 kWh/kg
- Bumped PySAM version to 6+ and HOPP to 3.2.0
- Removed defunct conda build and upload scripts
- Return full solution dictionary from ProFAST, allowing access to CRF and WACC
- Renamed code from GreenHEART to H2Integrate
- Added iron processing framework and capabilities [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added Martin and Rosner iron ore models, performance and cost for each [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added Rosner direct reduction iron (DRI) model, performance and cost [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added Martin transport module for performance and cost of iron [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)
- Added generalized Stinn cost model for electrolysis of arbitrary materials [PR 90](https://github.com/NREL/H2Integrate/pull/90)

## v0.1.4 [4 February 2025]

- Adds `CoolProp` to `pyproject.toml`
- Changes units of `lcoe_real` in `HOPPComponent` from "MW*h" to "kW*h"
- Adds `pre-commit`, `ruff`, and `isort` checks, and CI workflow to ensure these steps aren't
  skipped.
